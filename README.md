## Evolving investment strategies using genetic programming
***

May/June of 2013 a [friend of mine](http://stuartreid.co.za) and I worked on an AI varsity project together.
The aim of the project was to evolve [decision trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree) using an [evolutionary programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_programming) technique.
We made the choice to evolve decision trees that could be used to decide, given a set of financial data for a trading stock, whether to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)">short</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_(finance)">long</a> that stock.
Using [genetic programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming) we evolved the tree using real stock data from 62 IT stocks off the S&P 500. We did a comparitive study between the performance of trees evolved using financial [fundamental analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_analysis) against [technical analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis) as well as the average movement of the market (for those stocks) of the year 2011.
